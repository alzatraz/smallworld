## Subway line generation

### Geometry
We generated a complete network which included two types of lines : 'slow' lines (like the Parisian 'métro') and 'fast' lines (like the Parisian 'Météor' or RER).

The 'slow' lines generation was the biggest part of the job. We built them as follows :
- we generated random segments. The number of segments to generate was determined by a truncated gaussian distribution. For each segment, the two extreme points were chosen preferentially in the suburbs of the city (gaussian)
